In short 'Examples of Common Noun' is a 'class' and 'Examples of proper noun' is 'object'.
Class - class is a description of an object.
class Test:
    #attributes; like variables, functions

It defines various attributes of an object.
Eg
l1 = [10, 20, 30]
l1.append(40)
l1.show()

Attributes - Attributes are member variable and member function
class Test:
    x = 5
    def f1():
        # some code

x and f1 are attributes

Object - Object is an instance of a class
objects are of two types
    - class object
    - instance object

t1 = Test()
t2 = Test()     t1 and t2 are instance object of Test clas

Encapsulation - An act of combining 'properties' and 'methods' related to same object is known as Encapsulation.
Eg. ramesh.running()        Here, ramesh is 'object' and running is 'action' which is a function.
class is a way to implement Encapsulation.
